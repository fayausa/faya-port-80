# Beyond:80 Protocol

### The Movement Begins With You.

## What is Beyond:80?

Beyond:80 is a monthly, community-led tech gathering built on the legacy of **FAYA:80** (read FAYA port 80) — a pioneering initiative by FAYA Corporation that brought together tech enthusiasts to explore, discuss, and decode emerging trends in the world of technology.

While FAYA:80 created a powerful platform for professionals, entrepreneurs, and developers to stay updated and inspired, Beyond:80 is about taking that spirit **beyond** — into your campuses, towns, offices, and communities.

It’s a space where both beginners and experts sit around the same table, where the goal is not perfection, but participation. It’s about igniting peer group learning, creating communities of practice, and building a culture where technology conversations are consistent, inclusive, and locally rooted.

**Beyond:80 is not a top-down event.** It’s not hosted by one organisation or run from a central place. It’s a movement that begins with **you**.

> If you can gather a few curious minds and create a safe space to learn, share, and grow, that’s Beyond:80.

## What to do before the event

- Pick a fixed day of the month (like the 2nd Saturday)  
- Finalize your venue (college, café, coworking space, library, etc.)  
- Choose a topic or focus for the session  
- Find one person to do Tech Bytes and one domain expert

## Things to Keep in Mind

- Don’t wait for things to be perfect. Just start.  
- Keep it real and local. Big things grow from small groups.  
- Make it welcoming for everyone – beginners, experts, introverts, and dreamers.  
- Let the energy come from people, not from structure.
